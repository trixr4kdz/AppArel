# Preliminary Proposal Document

Ever had trouble deciding what to wear on that very special occasion? AppArel will help solve that problem for the next time you are planning your clothes for your next event. The main goal of this application is to act as a sort of virtual closet that fits in your pocket. The application will use either the built-in camera, which would allow the user to simply take a picture of their clothes and store them in their phone, or allow users to search through an existing database of clothes to find their specific ones. If they choose to take a picture of their clothes, they will be given the option to enter the price and brand name of that clothing article. The main feature will allow the user to "mix and match" their clothes before they even wear them, which would theoretically save time and energy when going to an event. Additional features include categorizing the articles of clothing by type/kind such as dresses, pants, shoes, hats, etc., and the ability to show friends/ask for others' opinion through a sleek user interface.
