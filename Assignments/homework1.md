# Homework 1

**Problem 1.1, Stephens Page 12**
:  What are the basic tasks that all software engineering projects must handle?
> requirements gathering, high-level design, low-level design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance, and wrap-up

**Problem 1.2, Stephens page 12**
: Give a one sentence description of each of the tasks you listed in Exercise 1.
> * requirements gathering - Learn the customer’s wants and needs.
> * high-level design - Describe the major pieces of the application and how they interact.
> * low-level design - Provide more detail about how to build the pieces of the application so that the programmers can actually implement them.
> * development - Write code to implement the application.
> * testing - Use the application under different circumstances to try to detect any flaws or
bugs.
> * deployment - Roll out the application to the users.
> * maintenance - Implement bug fixes, additions, enhancements, and future versions of the program.
> * wrap-up - Evaluate the project’s history to determine what went right and what went wrong so that you can repeat the good things and avoid the bad things in future projects.

**Problem 2.4, Stephens page 26**
: Like Microsoft Word, Google Docs [sic] provides some simple change tracking tools. Go to http://www.google.com/docs/about/ to learn more and sign up [if you do not have an account already]. Then create a document, save it, close it, reopen it, and make changes to it as you did in Exercise 1.

**Problem 2.5, Stephens page 26**
: What does JBGE stand for and what does it mean?
> JBGE, or Just Barely Good Enough, is the philosophy that you shouldn't write any more code documentation or comments than is absolutely necessary.

**Problem 3.2, Stephens page 51**
: Use critical path methods to find the total expected time from the project's start for each task's completion. Find the critical path. What are the tasks on the critical path? What is the total expected duration of the project in working days?

**Problem 3.4, Stephens page 51**
: Build a Gantt chart for the network you drew in Exercise 3. [Yes, I know, you weren't assigned that one — however, when you do Exercise 2 you should have enough information for this one.] Start on Wednesday, January 1, 2020, and don't work on weekends or the following holidays: New Year's Day - January 1, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day - January 20, President's Day - February 17.

**Problem 3.6, Stephens page 51**
: In addition to losing time from vacation and sick leave, projects can suffer from problems that just strike out of nowhere. Sort of a bad version of deus ex machina. For example, senior management could decide to switch your target platform from Windows desktop PSs to the latest smartwatch technology. Or a strike in the Far East could delay the shipment of your new servers. Or one of your developers might move to Iceland. How can you handle these sorts of completely unpredictable problems?

**Problem 3.8, Stephens page 51**
: What are the two biggest mistakes you can make while tracking tasks?
> The biggest mistake you can make while tracking tasks is not taking action when a task slips. At a minimum, you need to pay closer attention to the task so that you can take action if it’s in trouble.

> The second biggest mistake is piling more people on the task and assuming they can cut the total time. Unless the new people have particularly useful expertise, bringing them up to speed may make the task take even longer.

**Problem 4.1, Stephens page 82**
: List five characteristics of good requirements.
> clear, unambiguous, consistent, prioritized, verifiable

**Problem 4.3, Stephens page 82**
: Suppose you want to build a program called TimeShifter to upload and download files at scheduled times while you're on vacation. The following list shows some of the applications requirements.

  * Allow users to monitor uploads/downloads while away from the office.
  > B
  * Let the user specify website log-in parameters such as an Internet address, a port, a username, and a password.
  > U, F
  * Let the user specify upload/download parameters such a number of retries if there's a problem.
  > U, F
  * Let the user select an Internet location, a local file, and a time to perform the upload/download.
  > U, F
  * Let the user schedule uploads/downloads at any time.
  > N
  * Allow uploads/downloads to run at any time.
  > N
  * Make uploads/downloads transfer at least 8 Mbps.
  > N
  * Run uploads/downloads sequentially. Two cannot run at the same time.
  > N
  * If an upload/download is scheduled for a time when another is in progress, it waits until the other one finishes.
  > N
  * Perform schedule uploads/downloads.
  > F
  * Keep a log of all attempted uploads/downloads and whether the succeeded.
  > F
  * Let the user empty the log.
  > U, F
  * Display reports of upload/download attempts.
  > U, F
  * Let the user view the log reports on a remote device such as a phone.
  > U, F
  * Send an e-mail to an administrator if an upload/download fails more than its maximum retry number of times.
  > U, F
  * Send a text message to an administrator if an upload/download fails more than it's maximum return number of times.
  > U, F

For this exercise, list the audience-oriented categories for each requirement. Are there requirements in each category? [If not, state why not…]
> All the categories include at least one requirement except for implementation requirements, which is empty. You might need to buy new hardware or network bandwidth to support the application, but you’re presumably performing uploads and downloads now, so you may already have everything you need. In that case, there are no implementation requirements.

**Problem 4.9, Stephens page 83-84**
: Figure 4-1 [right] shows the design for a simple hangman game that will run on smartphones. When you click the New Bame button, the program picks a random mystery word from a large list and starts a new game. Then if you click a letter, either the letter is filled in where it appears in the mystery word, or a new piece of Mr. Bones's skeleton appears. In either case, the letter you clicked is grayed out so that you don't pick it again. If you guess all the letters in the mystery word, the game displays a message that says, "Congratulations, you won!" If you build Mr. Bones's complete skeleton, a message says, "Sorry, you lost."
